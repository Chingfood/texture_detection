# texture_detection
This is the final project for the Computer Vision class. The goal is to classify different textures. The code is written in python.

The goal of this project is to build a classifier that could classify textures. 
An image dataset called Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) with a total of 47 different classes and each class contains 120 images(a total of 5640 images) is used in this project. 
Within the DTD dataset, a provided split that equally split the dataset into three parts with each part denote as training, validating, and testing is also followed in this project.
